IMA Database of Mineral Properties

# IMA Database of Mineral Properties

Minerals data by international mineralogical Association.

## Introduction

In this report, I investigated the IMA database of mineral properties. The dataset contains mineral names, unique formula(RRUFF and IMA) in plain text(f.e., Abellaite is NaPb2+2(CO2)2(OH) which means NaPb2+(CO3)2(OH), IMA numbers, RRUFF IDs, Chemistry elements, countries of locality, Structural Group and Age.



## Problem Statement

### To Identify:

1. How many minerals were approved?

2. Which crystal system does the mineral have.

3. What is the oldest known Age?

4. The most abundant chemical elements.

5. Which country has the highest number of minerals.




### The following questions will be answered:


(a) What is the most abundant chemical elements?


(b) Regions where minerals are more common.


(c) The oldest known age.


(d) Properties of the minerals.


(e) Mineral Status.


The data was downloaded from Kaggle datasets:

## Recommendation

Based on the analysis, USA is the region with high concentration of minerals, the company should focus more on the region.The company should prioritize exploring areas with high concentration.

Exploring areas with high concentration of mineral with unique properties such as the monoclinic crystal system or high valence elements like CA SI OH. 

By taking these factors into account, there is a likelihood of increase in finding new mineral deposits. 

## Conclusion

3600 minerals were approved.

USA is the region where minerals are common although USA has 814 minerals while Russia has 810 minerals. 

Fe P OH is the most abundant chemical elements with 23 minerals.

The minerals are mostly monoclinic, orthorhombic and hexagonal crystal systems. 1799 minerals were monoclinic crystal system, 1043 minerals were orthorhombic crystal and 1004 minerals are hexagonal crystal system.

The Oldest Known Age(Ma) is 1271.84.

There is a correlation between Year First Published and Oldest Known Age with a value of 1 and -0.32 respectively.
